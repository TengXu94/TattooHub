In this application each person has an account, verified by the instagram API. Since a real tattoo, once done, is for the whole life, if we are not going to delete it in a painful way, a person wants to be sure that the chosen tattoo will look nice in his skin. Here comes the first problem, each person has a different color of skin, even if it's a slight difference, and each tattoo has different color and shape.
That's the main purpose of this mobile application: by retrieving images of tattoos in the web filtered by their color and the color of the skin of the person who wears it , this application will clarify every doubt about it.\\
Furthermore, each retrieved image can be saved in one of private/public category of the account in use, in order to see it again further in the future or just because it's a beautiful picture or even to keep it as an idea for the tattoo artist.
